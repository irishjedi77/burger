# burger

This project uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM to create a "burger logger" called Eat-Da-Burger.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

When a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger that is waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the "devoured" section of the page.

The app stores every burger in a MySQL database, whether devoured or not.
